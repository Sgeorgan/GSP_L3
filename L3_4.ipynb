    "Spatial joins are operations that combine data from two or more spatial data sets based on their geometric relationship. In the previous sections, we got to know two specific cases of spatial joins: Point-in-polygon queries and intersects-queries. However, there is more to using the geometric relationship between features and between entire layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial join operations require two input parameters: the predicament, i.e., the geometric condition that needs to be met between two geometries, and the join-type: whether only rows with matching geometries are kept, or all of one input tableâ€™s rows, or all records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geopandas (using shapely to implement geometric relationships) supports a standard set of geometric predicates, that is similar to most GIS analysis tools and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- intersects\n",
    "\n",
    "- contains\n",
    "\n",
    "- within\n",
    "\n",
    "- touches\n",
    "\n",
    "- crosses\n",
    "\n",
    "- overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric predicaments are expressed as verbs, so they have an intuitive meaning. See the shapely user manual for a detailed description of each geometric predicate. https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/predicates.html"
